                     We will use this note to contain an historical/critical introduction to the
                     text of the Smith diary.
                     -->
                     <p>In a short diary entry dated 2 August 1862,
                        Lucius Smith, a 27-year-old farmer and sometime schoolteacher living near
                        New Albany, OH with his parents and seven younger siblings, notes that he
                        "Helped at Hay &amp; oats" half the day on his family’s farm, worries about his
                        own sorghum operation, reports on a war meeting in New Albany, and refers to a
                        discussion with a neighbor about a piece of farming equipment. What Smith's
                        diary lacks in depth or analysis on any particular topic, it makes up for by
                        revealing how diverse elements of rural culture in central Ohio during the
                        Civil War weave into an individual life. No internal or external evidence
                        suggests that Smith intended his diary to serve as anything other than a
                        personal record. An account book, inventory, or personal almanac would
                        likely exhibit more structure, but Smith blends those genres by recording
                        business transactions, accounts of equipment, and comments on the weather
                        with observations on a number of other recurring topics. Regarding the Civil
                        War, Smith writes about the draft and appeals for enlistments at war
                        meetings, arrests for treasonable language, news of battles and debates over
                        slavery, and the fate of friends and acquaintances serving in the Union
                        Army. Writing about work on his cane mill and his family's farm, Smith
                        speaks of digging wells and hauling stone, brick, and wood. He describes
                        equipment for farming, milling sorghum, making molasses, and he records
                        details about the weather and the progress of his crops. Writing about the
                        social life of his community, he speaks of helping one another with chores,
                        attending parties, participating in hunting competitions, and listening to
                        speeches and sermons. In sum, as we discuss in more detail below, Smith
                        provides an eye-level view of diverse aspects of rural life and work in Ohio
                        during the Civil War.</p>
                     <p rend="h3">
                        Mid-nineteenth-century Family Dynamics   
                     </p>
                     <p>In 1862, when Lucius Clark Smith penned this diary, he would have been a young man roughly 27 years of age.  Modern observers are 
                        apt to question the normalcy of a man this age residing at home with his father, mother, and seven younger siblings.  
                        Yet, in the context of mid-nineteenth century agricultural life, there is little abnormal about this living situation.
                     </p>
                     <p>Demographic historians provide ample data suggesting that the household configuration of the Smiths in the early 1860s was not unheard of.  
                        The Smith household, numbering nine individuals as of the 1860 Federal Census, was somewhat larger than the national average of six <bibl><ref target="Ancestry1860">1860 Census</ref></bibl>.  Rural 
                        families, however, were more likely to experience higher rates of fertility than those in more urban areas.  Moreover, five of these children
                        would have been under the age of 18 at the time of the census, so their residence at home is unsurprising <bibl><ref target="Easterlin">Easterlin, Alter, and Condran</ref></bibl>.
                     </p>
                     <p>To explain the continued residence of the three eldest sons well into their twenties requires an examination of contemporary understandings
                        of adulthood and familial relationships in agricultural settings.  Our modern understandings of the teenage years and young adulthood are 
                        largely by-products of the twentieth century and would have been unknown to those living in the 1860s.  Adulthood was vested not in a specific 
                        age-bracket, but in an understanding of status based on dependence or independence.  The nature of parent-child relationships on farms led to 
                        what we would think of as a protracted period of dependence, resting on the mutual obligations that existed between fathers and sons.  Fathers 
                        were obligated to provide a practical education for sons to ensure that they had prospects as they moved into adulthood; children were in turn 
                        bound to provide labor and obedience as long as necessary.  Quite often, sons labored on the family farm till at least the age of 21 or beyond, 
                        at which point, they would ideally establish themselves on nearby farms.  By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, however, increasing 
                        land scarcity had some sons staying on the family farm for longer periods of time.
                     </p>
                     <p>The alternative to establishing an independent farm near to home was often to escape agriculture altogether and take up an urban occupation.  
                        As industrialization and urbanization increased in the second half of the 1800s, farmers feared that their sons would leave the farm never to 
                        return.  Articles in magazines and newspapers gave voice to that fear.  One specifically provided advice to young men thinking of abandoning 
                        the family farm: 
                        <quote type="block">“Again, it is your duty to ‘Stick to the Farm;’ your father has already reached the meridian of life, and has commenced to 
                        descend the ‘western declivity.’  He has long looked forward to the day when he could relinquish the active labors of the farm to his son.  
                        To this end he has taken special pains to instruct you in all things connected with good husbandry, and now, when he needs you most, when 
                        he feels the infirmities of age creeping on, when he needs your aid, will you leave him to struggle on?” <bibl><ref target="BoysStick">"Boys, Stick to the 
                        Farm"</ref></bibl></quote>
                        Thus, by the end of the nineteenth century, more farmers focused on keeping at least one of their adult sons on the farm rather than seeing 
                        them flee the area when unable to become settled on a nearby farm of their own <bibl><ref target="Frank">Frank, 147</ref></bibl>.
                     </p>
                     <p>The period of dependency for young farming males most frequently ended upon one of the hallmark ritual passages into adulthood: marriage.  
                        As historian Stephen Frank notes, “Until a son came of age, married, and established an independent household, he labored primarily for his

                        corresponding state of home-residence) of Lucius Clark Smith was not anomalous for the time.  During the period of 1850 through the Civil 
                        War, the median age for native-born white men to marry was 26.6 for men (22.9 for women) <bibl><ref target="FitchAndRuggles">Fitch and Ruggles, 63</ref></bibl>.  At 27 in 1862, 
                        Lucius Clark Smith, as well as the rest of his twenty-something brothers, were well within the normal range to be unmarried and thus dwelling at home.  
                     </p>
                     <p>Perhaps the only thing abnormal about the Smith household was the degree to which Lucius was able to engage in his own economic operations.  
                        The establishment of his own mill on his father’s land indicates a degree of autonomy that places Lucius well on the way to independent adulthood.  
                        Without examining the will of Archibald Smith, it is difficult to precisely determine what the status of this land grant was, but likely it 
                        represented Archibald’s patrimony to Lucius: the father’s obligation to see the child set-up with some means of economic self-sufficiency during 
                        a time of declining land availability.  Whatever the case, it is clear that work done both on the farm and on Lucius’ mill operations were both 
                        family affairs.

                     <p><hi rend="bold">Farm Mechanization and Power in the Nineteenth Century</hi></p>
                     <p>The explosion of farm mechanization that marked the 19th century, including the Sorghum mills that 
                        Lucius Smith invested in, called for an equal increase in the rise of farm power to operate those new 
                        mechanisms. Before this time, water-powered mills – almost exclusively flour mills and sawmills – had 
                        been sufficient for most farmer’s needs, but not all of these new farm mechanisms could be conveniently 
                        located close enough to a running water source to take advantage of water power. Instead, new farm 
                        mechanisms embraced the idea of modular power, having a simple belt pulley by which power could be 
                        delivered from any source.</p>
                     <p>Chief among these new powers were animal power and steam power. However, as portable steam engines were 
                        still a relatively new, and expensive, innovation – the first portable steam engine was patented in 1849 
                        – farmers were much more likely to use animal power, horse power specifically. In a horse-power, a long 
                        wooden beam, or “sweep,” was attached on one end to a horse’s harness and on the other end to the outside 
                        of a main gear wheel. The horse would then be lead around the power, turning the main gear wheel and this 
                        rotation was transferred through smaller gears and shafts to another belt pulley, which would drive the 
                        belt, which would power the mechanism. This arrangement was not only cheaper and more proven than steam 
                        power but gave the advantages of portability and flexibility of configuration that traditional water power 
                        lacked. Further, the horse-power could be geared up or down to provide high-torque/low-speed or 
                        low-torque/high-speed power to a variety of mechanisms.</p> 
                     <p>Sorghum mills, even though they were relatively new innovations in the mid-19th century, were fairly simple 
                        mechanisms, familiar to anyone who has ever seen an old-fashioned laundry mangle: two (or more) large steel 
                        cylinders were situated very close together and rotated counter to each other. Cane was fed into the mill 
                        and between these cylinders which squeezed the juice from the cane. Lucius C. Smith’s initial mill, with 
                        which he is so preoccupied in the first half of this journal, is undoubtedly a horizontal mill, in which 
                        the cylinders are placed horizontally and powered by a belt-pulley attached to a seperate horse-power. 
                        However, the weaknesses of this system becomes apparent in Smith’s own account of his operations. Though 
                        he had just gotten a new one turned on September 6th, the counter-shaft of his horse power broke on October 
                        2nd, less than four weeks later, due to the sheer stress of the torque applied in night-and-day operations.</p>
                     <p>Smith’s second mill, however, avoided this problem. The John L. Gill and Son No. 6 Vertical Cane mill, which 
                        Smith purchsed for $88 on October 3rd, had one central 12” roller and two secondary 9” rollers arranged 
                        vertically with an integrated horse power. This integrated horse power, two sweeps attached to the drive 
                        shaft above the mill, obviated the need for the counter-shafts and tumble-shafts that would deliver power 
                        from a separate horse-power and thus eliminated two potential points of failure in Smith’s previous arrangement.
                        It is worth noting, however, that even with this new, more advanced mill, Smith had enough Cane supply in the 
                        Autumn of 1862 that he continued using both mills simultaneously to keep up with the demand for his services.</p>

                        Sorghum and the Production of Molasses in Nineteenth Century Ohio

                     <p>
                        Production of molasses from sorghum was a fairly new agricultural activity during the mid-nineteenth century. 
                        It had cultural and  economic implications. Several books published about farming during the period 
                        describe the process in some detail. In <title level="m">History of Ohio Agriculture</title> (1900), Charles William Burkett 
                        mentions that sorghum was introduced to Ohio by the early settlers in the nineteenth century. These early 
                        settlers were interested in developing family farms. In <title level="m">Soils and Crops of the Farm</title>, 
                        George Espy Morrow and Thomas Forsyth Hunt observe,<quote> “Sorghum is the only agriculturally important plant 
                           which has been introduced into the United States since the American Revolution...and was widely distributed

                        <lb/>The Sorghum cane, which is supposed to be native to China, came to United States via France in the 1850s. Before the 
                        introduction of sorghum, maple sap, juice from beet and sugarcane were used to produce sugar. However, those posed 
                        specific difficulties to the country in which local industries were trying to find a national market: the sugar produced 
                        from the other kinds of canes dried up fast. In Ohio, sorghum was initially raised in small scales and molasses made from 
                        it were sold in local markets. In the Springfield market, for instance, molasses from sorghum were sold at 75 cents a 
                        gallon at the outset. The Leffel sorghum mill at Springfield thrived during the 1860s. Its owner Joseph Leffel had two 
                        acres of cane which he crushed using horse power. Some of Leffel's contemporary sorghum mill owners like Rev. Abraham 
                        Myers harnessed the water of the Mad River for power <bibl><ref target="Prince">Prince 84-5</ref></bibl>. The standard 
                        stages in making sorghum molasses included growing of sorghum cane, followed by grinding the cane at the Cane house 
                        using horse power and then, boiling the juice in large vessels. </p>
                        <p>Mid-nineteenth century Ohio may have used more 
                        large scale agricultural machines than any one state at the time <bibl><ref target="DocsMsgs">Documents, Messages... 504</ref></bibl> . 
                        The Steam Thresher and Sugar Mills were used for grinding sorghum. The latter was invented 
                        around 1856-57 for specifically this purpose unlike the Steam Thresher which was used for grinding several other 
                        kinds of grains. Both the Steam Thresher and the Sugar Mill helped cut down labor costs.
                        Some late nineteenth century documents also state that the produced molasses were first taken home in large barrels 
                        by the farmers and then, the rest was sold. Evidently, in the nineteenth century the sorghum industry was more geared 
                        toward domestic rather than a large scale commercial enterprise for many mill owners. At the same time, the potential of 
                        the industry to grow rapidly was recognized by farmers and mill owners.

                        <lb/>On 7th January 1862 a State Sorghum Convention was held at Columbus, Ohio. The convention not only discussed the culture 
                        of growing sorghum and manufacturing molasses from it, but also promoted certain kinds of pans and mills as facilitators 
                        of more profitable and durable products than others. <title level="j">The Ohio Cultivator</title> documents a debate between a sales agent of 
                        "Implements and Machinery," and the secretary of the convention on the subject of advertising at the 
                        convention <bibl><ref target="Bateham">Bateham and Sullivan 156-57</ref></bibl>. Interestingly, the same volume features a recipe called "Mr. Thorn's Sorghum Cake" 
                        which includes Sorghum molasses among its ingredients. Thus, the mid-nineteenth century agricultural culture in Ohio was closely related to the growing 
                        acceptance and significance of sorghum molasses. However, the growth of the industry was slow over the decades in the state. 
                        H. Talcott, a member of the Jefferson Sugar Manufacturing Company , presented a paper in the Agricultural convention recorded 
                        in the <title level="s">Annual Report of the Ohio State Board of Agriculture </title>(1883), to endorse the promotion of the sorghum-molasses 
                        industry in Ohio: he proposed growing sorghum as a rotation crop with corn and charted 
                        its many uses which included preparation of sugar, cooking molasses, rum vinegar and prepared coffee.  Talcott's presentation is 
                        prompted by the rather scattered nature of the sorghum industry till the 1880s 
                        and <quote>"no very good results or much practical use made of the crop" </quote>(90).

                     <p> Thus, Lucius Smith's investment in the Cane House, which surfaces in most of his journal entries from August to December 
                        1862, represents a  relatively novel agricultural and industrial development in the state. Smith follows state-of-the-art 
                        technologies for producing molasses. Furthermore, Smith's visit to different cities in search of the 
                        right apparatuses for his mill is put into perspective by the history of the manufacturing businesses, 
                        publicity and sales campaigns around the sorghum molasses industry in 1860s Ohio. </p>

                        Throughout the months of August and September Lucius Clark Smith expressed anxiety about the draft and referred to men volunteering out of fear of being drafted.
                        On August 4, 1862, the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, issued an order to draft 300,000 men into the military to serve for nine months. Although each state 
                        was called to supply their required quota of men by the fifteenth of August, Ohio was granted repeated extensions due to the mounting pressure to provide regiments
                        in the defense of its southern border. The draft was first postponed to September 16 <bibl><ref target="InRelation">"In Relation to the Draft"</ref></bibl> and then for a second time until October 1 
                     <bibl><ref target="DraftPostponed">"Drafting Postponed"</ref></bibl>.
                     <p>
                         During each postponement Ohio's Unionist governor David Tod encouraged citizens at large to voluntarily enlist. He also urged the commissioners responsible for 
                         organizing the draft in their respective district to do likewise. It was during the first postponement that Tod encouraged the county commissioners directly to use 
                         this time to recruit more regiments in order to fulfill Ohio's quota of 23,000 militia men through volunteers, <quote>"thereby sav[ing] the trouble, expense and vexation

                     </p>   
                     <p>
                         Just two days before the first postponement was set to end, Tod announced the second extension and concluded with an impassioned plea to Ohio's men to answer the call 
                         to service: <quote>"The necessity for the force called for by the President is now apparent to all. Our very firesides are threatened in the desperate efforts of the rebels 
                         to destroy our glorious Government. Rally then, noble men of Ohio, and with the grand effort to fill up the ranks"</quote><bibl><ref target="DraftPostponed">"Drafting 
                         Postponed"</ref></bibl>. Between September 15 and October 1, however, about 8,000 men voluntarily enlisted, which left some 12,000 still to be drafted. Thus, in spite of the
                         Governor's efforts to solicit voluntary enlistment since the initial announcement of the draft in August, three-fourths of the counties in Ohio commenced the draft on the first 
                         of October in order to meet their respective quotas <bibl><ref target="TheDraft">"The Draft in Ohio"</ref></bibl>.

                        While many counties and townships held meetings to encourage enlistment and <quote>"devis[e] ways and means to raise each town's quota and avoid the draft"</quote>, the men of
                        Ohio were clearly reluctant to voluntarily enlist <bibl><ref target="HowtoAvoidaDraft">"How to Avoid a Draft"</ref></bibl>. Part of the difficulty in attracting volunteers was 
                        attributed to the requirement in Ohio that volunteers provide three years of service rather than the nine months required of draftees. <title level="j">The Daily Cleveland Herald</title>
                        in late December of 1862 characterized the draft as a failure that <quote>"engendered much bad feeling in portions of the State, and has proved a slow process in filling up the Union 
                        army rank and file" </quote>. The article concludes by suggesting, "The same effort and expenditure in enlisting nine months volunteers would have filled the muster rolls sooner and fuller" 
                        <bibl><ref target="TheDraftFailure">"The Draft a Failure"</ref></bibl>. For those counties who secured their full quota through voluntary enlistment, however, the increased service requirement 
                        of the volunteers was held up as testimony to their collective patriotism - that they sent "three year soldiers" rather than "nine months [sic] men" <bibl><ref target="TheDraftOver">"The Draft

                        Opposition to the 1862 draft seemed to have taken on a different character in contrast to the well-known opposition of 1863. Around the time of the Conscription Act of March 1863, there was
                        bitter opposition against the exemption which allowed for a wealthy draftee to hire an able-bodied substitute in his place. Such resistance appeared not to take such precedence a year earlier.
                        A letter to the editor in 1862, written under the pseudonym "Justice," expressed specific outrage that state and county officers, deputies, and clerks were exempted from the draft altogether.
                        The author asserts that <quote>"they are the only men in the State, (excepting contractors) who are making money, and consequently, if drafted, are better able to employ substitutes than any other
                        class of individual in the State" </quote> <bibl><ref target="EditorsHerald">"Editors Herald"</ref></bibl>. "Justice" did not, like his compatriots would a year later, single out wealthy Ohioans for criticism.

                        In August of 1862, <title level="j">The Crisis</title> accused a "Black Republican postmaster" of using his position to shield his three sons from the draft, instead of shouldering his nationalistic 
                        duty to God and country <bibl><ref target="RepublicansCreeping"></ref>"Republicans Creeping Out of the Draft"</bibl>. While such a criticism might have been legitimately leveled at Columbus' wealthy elite, several citizens instead chose to 
                        aim their ire at Ohio's civil servants. This fit well with other examples of Democratic attacks toward Republicans. The <title level="j">Ohio Statesmen</title> decried the practice of Pennsylvania and 
                        New York, both of which postponed their drafts. The newspaper accused the two states of providing "fewer men to the war than the Democrats or Conservatives" (<title level="j">Newark Advocates</title>). In both cases the 
                        Democratic papers used the draft to critique Republicans' administration and avoidance of the draft without opposing the draft itself.

                        During 1862, those who openly criticized the draft were liable to be arrested for charges of disloyalty, treasonable language, and discouraging enlistment. One such notable arrest that is directly 
                        referenced in Smith's diary is that of Edson B. Olds. Olds had served as a congressional representative from 1849 until his failed bid for re-election in 1854.Before the draft was officially announced 
                        in August, Olds delivered a speech about the draft that eventually led to popular uproar and later to his arrest. In July, 1862, the <title level="j">Lancaster Eagle</title> published a response from 
                        Olds defending his speech. He claimed his views were misrepresented and that he was not discouraging men from enlisting. Rather, Olds argued he was only presenting a vision of what might happen should the Republicans
                        institute a draft. He wrote, as long as the war focused on the <quote>"putting down of rebellion, and the 'maintenance of the Constitution as it is, and the Union as it was,' the Democracy would freely shed 
                        their blood, and liberally give their money, but so soon as it ceased to be a war for the suppression of rebellion, and became an abolition war, no Democrat would be found willing to volunteer. I further 
                        remarked: that the Government in all probability would make a draft for soldiers, and that drafting would be in the hands of Republicans; that the party would want to keep Republicans at home to vote, and

                        His defense, however, was ultimately ineffective. Olds was arrested for treasonable language later that month. On the one hand, local Democratic papers like <title level="j">The Crisis</title> characterized 
                        the arrest as "arbitrary" and as a "kidnapping" <bibl><ref target="ArrestofEdson">"Arrest of Edson B. Olds"</ref></bibl>. On the other hand, Republican papers characterized Olds as a "notorious traitor"

                        Smith wrote in his private diary that the arrest and imprisonment of  Dr. E.B. Olds manifested "considerable feeling" among the Democrats. Olds' arrest and the subsequent partisan squabble illustrate the contentious
                        nature of politics during wartime. Discontent over the draft in 1862 served, like any other issue, as a divisive battleground for Ohio's politicians. Democrats used the draft and the imprisonment of predominantly 
                        Democratic citizens to mount a trenchant critique of Republican administration of the government.

                        Borderlands and Hinterlands: Cincinnati and the Ohio River During the Civil War  
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Located just over 100 miles southwest of Lucius Clark Smith’s home, Cincinnati functioned as an important source of supplies and soldiers for 
                        Union forces during the Civil War, a role largely consequent of its position on the Ohio River and its status as—in the words of one contemporary 
                        newspaper—<quote>“the commercial emporium of the West” <bibl><ref target="RaleighRegister">"Field Operations"</ref></bibl></quote>. These two facts are, of course, related: Cincinnati developed as a bustling city 
                        for trade largely because of the emergence during the 19th century of the steamboat, which made river trade a substantially less burdensome 
                        undertaking in the region. Propelled by the development of railways—<quote>“By the eve of the Civil War, Ohio boasted some 3,000 miles of track, . . . 
                           the most of any state in the entire nation” <bibl><ref target="Phillips">Phillips</ref></bibl></quote>—Cincinnati became host to an influx of immigrants, particularly from Ireland and Germany. 
                        By 1850 <quote>“47.2 percent of Cincinnatians were immigrants, and more than 70 percent came from either Ireland or Germany”<bibl><ref target="Phillips">Phillips</ref></bibl></quote>. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        These immigrants tended to be Catholics, and, coupled with large swaths of transplanted southerners, they constituted a largely Democratic voting 
                        bloc—one frequently opposed to the War and to emancipation. Contemporary sources reveal that at the root of this opposition lay unease about their 
                        own security in a post-emancipation world: as a foreign observer touring Cincinnati in 1863 remarked, <quote>“The jealousy of the low Germans and Irish against the free negro 
                        was sufficient to set them against the war which would have brought four million of their black rivals in competition for that hard and dirty work which 
                        American freedom bestowed on them” <bibl><ref target="Klement">qtd. in Klement 100</ref></bibl></quote>. Propagating this alarmist sentiment, Ohio Democratic Congressman Samuel Sullivan Cox, in a 
                        speech published in the September 9, 1862, edition of the <title level="j">Daily National Intelligencer</title>, stated, <quote>“The right and power to exclude Africans from the States 
                        North, being compatible with our system of State sovereignty and Federal supremacy, I assert that it is impolitic, dangerous, degrading, and unjust to the 
                        white men of Ohio and of the North to allow such immigration” <bibl><ref target="CoxSpeech">"Speech"</ref></bibl></quote>. These feelings of dissent largely undergirded the more visible role Cincinnati played in 
                        providing supplies and combatants.

                        Throughout his entries for September, 1862, Lucius Clark Smith repeatedly makes reference to the goings-on in Cincinnati—later to be referred to as the 
                        Defense of Cincinnati—whereby the city was threatened by Confederate forces. Contemporary sources paint a vivid portrait of the struggle.

                        The September 4, 1862, edition of the <title level="j">Milwaukee Daily Sentinel</title> reports that, on September 1st, <quote>“[Confederate Major General] Kirby Smith’s army appeared

                        Lexington, they prepared to mount an attack on Cincinnati; consequently, Union Major General Lew Wallace declared martial law and seized sixteen 
                        steamboats to be armed. Wallace would organize residents of Cincinnati, Covington, and Newport for defense. The Sentinel reports that on September 2nd, 
                        <quote>“Citizens are enrolling themselves rapidly in the different wards” and that “[t]he Forty-fifth and Ninety ninth Ohio are falling back slowly to Covington. . . .

                        On September 3rd, Ohio governor David Tod announced—in a declaration printed in the city papers and telegraphed throughout the state—the need for men to 
                        defend Cincinnati, stating that <quote>“all such bodies of men who are armed, will be received. They will repair at once to Cincinnati and report to Gen. Lew

                        It is difficult to overestimate the  Ohio River's importance during the Civil War. As the southern border of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, the river served as a border 
                        between slave states and free states and functioned as an obstacle for Confederates attempting to cross over into the north. Contemporary sources reference gunboats 
                        patrolling the river on a daily basis and also mention steamboats being used to transport Union troops throughout the region. Describing the fortifications being 
                        erected in and around Cincinnati, one newspaper cites the river’s importance to the area’s defense: <quote>“The Ohio river, from Columbus to Sedamsville, forms the 
                        segment of a circle, the length of the arc being nearly 12 miles, with a range of hills on the south of Covington and Newport for its base . . . completely commanding

                     John is Lucius Smith's second younger brother. Lucius refers to him throughout the journal, commonly 
                     in reference to labor shared by the brothers on family farm. John was particularly noted as helping 
                     Lucius with the labor on his well and his Mill. In the week of August 23rd 1862, Lucius also mentions 
                     that John was considering enlisting in the company that was presently raising, but expressed doubt
                     that he would actually commit. However, Lucius's prediction proved wrong within a year, as John and

                     Collins on at least two occassions seeking legal aid. On 9 August 1862 Lucius visits Collins
                     to put his property in his father's name "so that if I am drafed he can take and them Patent Right
                     men can stand off." In December Lucius notes that he found out he found out he was being sued by

                     mayor of Columbus from 1879-1880. Collins lived in Plains Township with his parents, Andrew and
                     Mary Collins until their death. He relocated to Columbus to study law 1858 and was admitted to

                  <desc>Several times throughout September, Smith mentions Cincinnati in reference to the events transpiring
                  there. On the week ending September 6th, Smith mentions that the Rebels under General Smith are advancing 
                  onto the city and that it has been put under martial law, along with neighboring towns. On the 12th, he
                  writes that thousands of people are going to Cincinnati to defend it, taking theirs guns, etc., and that 
                  the governor is already refusing people. Finally, on the week ending September 20th, Smith writes that
                  Cincinnati has been saved after "some of the severest fiting of the war." The trajectory of these events 
                  describes what has come to be known as the Defense of Cincinnati, about which the Editorial Introduction 
                  includes additional information.</desc>

                     and Eliza to get some things for his Cane works and during the week ending 25th October he sends 
                     someone to Columbus to get a pipe. He also mentions corresponding with Samual Smith from Columbus
                     on 7th September 1862. </desc>

                 <desc>John L. Gill, Sr. was a Columbus Tinner and one of the founding partners of the
                    Franklin Foundry. Gill took over sole proprietorship in 1852, then associated his son
                    with the business in 1857, taking the name "John L. Gill and Son" for the business. The
                    foundry was a major metal casting concern in Columbus in the 1850's and 1860's, specializing
                    in farm mechanism such as plows, mills and harvesters.
                    However, "John L. Gill and Son" is also a name associated specifically with sorghum production
                    in Ohio, being mentioned both in the first "Report of the Commissioner of Agriculture" to 
                    Congress in 1862 and the Ohio State Department of Agriculture report of the same year. While
                    both Gill Jr. and Sr. were both active in this aspect of the family business - both are
                    mentioned in the Sorgo Journal and Farm Machinist of 1865 - John L. Gill, Jr., the 
                    eponymous "and Son," seemed to have taken a more active role, being both the Secretary of
                    1862 and 1865 Ohio Sorghum Convention and appointed to a committee "to correspond with or visit
                    the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and secure, if possible, some mitigation of the duty
                    proposed to be assessed on Sorghum."
                    Nor were the Gills slow to capitalize on the advantage that their duel family businesses provided.
                    In the 1862 Ohio Cultivator, Gill Jr. responds to criticism that the Ohio Sorghum Convention, 
                    of which he was the Secretary, was monopolized by "the inventors, manufacturers and agents of Mills
                    and Evaporators, and was made an advertising medium" for them.

         <projectDesc>
            <p>This edition is the latest in a series of collaboratively produced electronic
               editions of previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in
               the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. Previous
               editions include "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody
               Hawthorne to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868 (currently
               being revised); "Dear Wife," twenty-one letters written by riverboat captain William
               B. Anderson to his wife Louisa while he plied the Ohio river during the height of the
               American Civil War, 1862&#x2013;1864; "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by Samuel Sullivan Cox;
               and "Louisa A. Doane's Journal of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853). These documentary
               editions are intended to provide wide exposure and access to manuscripts that might
               otherwise be difficult for scholars to discover and consult, and to provide users
               with a variety of tools for studying those texts. </p>
            <p>Each text was edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course offered
               by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University. The
               courses provide students with an opportunity to explore issues of textuality
               and mediation that arise when our cultural archives spread from page to screen and
               from library shelves to networked databases. Electronic textual editing serves as our
               vehicle for examining what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts
               in one medium are represented in another medium, especially with regard to the
               interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provide a contact zone
               that can help us reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can
               tell us about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
            <p>While providing a reliable textual edition is a <foreign xml:lang="lat">sine qua
                  non</foreign>, the Smith edition also explores ways of telling four stories
               inextricably woven into our work: the lives and historical milieu evoked by the
               texts, the history of the physical journal (including its recent restoration), the
               editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the text, and
               the mediation of our electronic delivery system. </p>

               <emph rend="bold">Scanning</emph>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF
               images at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and
               full quality before being loaded into the Media Manager application. All edges were
               overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image
               preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
               produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur in
               Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
               provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.

               based on the TEI markup language, and the resulting schemas are stored on a server

               <emph rend="bold">Markup of Physical Structure and Page Layout</emph>. The manuscript
                  <emph rend="bold">pages</emph>, encoded by the empty page break or &lt;pb/&gt;
               element, are the primary physical structures represented in the markup. Each
               &lt;pb&gt; element includes a &quot;facs&quot; attribute identifying the unique ID of
               a high-resolution scan of that image in the Media Manager application. <emph
                  rend="bold">Line breaks</emph> (i.e., lineation determined or influenced by the
               physical constraints of the page rather than compositional choices by the author) are
               encoded with the empty &lt;lb/&gt; element. No attributes are included in the
               &lt;lb&gt; element. Because Smith wrote on lined paper, when he skips a line printed
               on the paper for any reason, we encode a &lt;lb/&gt; that, in the view arranged by
               manuscript pages and lines, will appear as an empty numbered line. </p>
            <p>
               <emph rend="bold">Markup of Textual Structure</emph>. The <emph rend="bold">diary
                  entry</emph>, encoded by a &lt;div&gt; element with the attribute-value pair
               &quot;type='Entry'&quot;, constitutes the primary textual structure represented in
               the markup. Each entry contains a
               &lt;dateline&gt; element and one or more paragraphs. Each dateline may include a
               &lt;name&gt; element with (optionally) a @type attribute containing one of
               the following values: city, region; and a &lt;date&gt; element with a
               @when attribute whose value is in the form YYYY-MM-DD. The value of the
               @when attribute represents the editors' judgment about the actual date when the entry
               was composed; the contents of the &lt;date&gt; element represent what Smith actually
               wrote, even if he entered the date incorrectly.
            </p>
            <p>
               Entries consist of a series of <emph rend="bold">paragraphs</emph>. Where indicated
               by context, indentation of a line from the left margin of a page, line breaks part-way across
               a page, or additional white space between lines, paragraphs are encoded with the
               &lt;p&gt; element and no attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
               If present, any prefatory text preceding the dateline may be encoded as a
               &lt;head&gt; element at the beginning of an entry (i.e., within the
               &lt;div&gt;element and before the &lt;dateline&gt;).

            <p>
               <emph rend="bold">Level of Transcription/Encoding</emph>. This markup scheme supports
               a modest range of presentations, from semi-modernized/corrected to semi-diplomatic.
               The basic transcription follows the manuscript verbatim. Various manuscript features
               (e.g., cancellations, interlinear or marginal additions, tears in pages) are encoded,
               as are regularized versions of proper names and dates and standard versions of
               nonstandard spellings and expansions of abbreviations. </p>

                  mental, physical, or moral problems.  Essays on morality frequently referred to “fits of passion,” 
                  where the fits represented inappropriate, even sinful, behavior.  It is more likely, however, that 
                  Lucius was alluding to a physical or mental condition of “falling fits” or “nervous diseases” such 
                  as epilepsy.  A medical understanding of epilepsy existed by this time, though its causes and 
                  treatment remained open to much speculation. <bibl><ref target="evangelist">"The Boy who had 'Fits'"</ref><ref target="medical">"Westminster Hospital"<ref target="Ohio medical"></ref></ref></bibl></note> getting Better

                     his mill, usually refers to "horsepower." Horsepower, as it is understood today, 
                     is a unit for measuring power. The engines that drove sugar mills in the 1860s 
                     could have various range of horsepower: "an engine of 20 horse-power will drive 
                     a sugar mill having rollers 5 feet long and 28 inches diameter...An engine of 18 horse-power 
                     will work a mill 4 &#189; feet long and 26 inches diameter..." <bibl><ref target="Brande">Brande and Cox 643</ref></bibl>. Smith's truncation 
                     of horsepower to "horse," which was a familiar usage in the nineteenth century <bibl><ref target="Bourne">see Bourne 501</ref></bibl>, 
                     draws attention to the analogy of the output of steam engines with the power of horses that informed 
                     the unit of measurement.</note>

                  In context, this could only refer to a trip by rail; Worthington and Delaware were consecutive stops
                  on the branch of the New York Central Railroad that connected Columbus with Cleveland. What is less clear
                  however, is whether this refers to buying a ticket on the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Roalroad that
                  provided passenger service between the two cities, or simply getting a ride on a freight train passing 
                  through. However, if we accept historical averages of price per mile for the region at this time, the trip
                  would likely cost 45 to 50 cents per man, and this at a time when average daily income was near 80 cents. Given 
                  Smith's usual cost-consciousness, it is unlikely he or Goodrich would have paid so much to ride the 15 miles from 
                  Worthington to Delaware when they were willing to walk the same distance from New Albany to Worthington earlier 
                  in the same day.
